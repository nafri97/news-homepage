                <h1>The Bright Future of Web 3.0?</h1>
                <h2>From personal data pods to the 'spatial web', ideas are forming for the next stage in the evolution
                    of the worldwide web.
                </h2>
                <h3>By Greg Noone</h3><br>
                <p>
                    What will Web 3.0 look like? When considering the future of the worldwide web, it feels natural to
                    consult its inventor. Interviewed in 2005, Tim Berners-Lee looked back on his creation with pride,
                    and hoped that the trajectory of its evolution would continue to be informed by its original,
                    decentralised architecture.

                    “I feel like the web should be something which basically doesn’t try to coerce people in doing,
                    putting, particular sorts of things on it – that it’s open, like a sheet of white paper,”
                    Berners-Lee said. “The problems of bad information out there are… problems, I think, with humanity.”

                    The solution to these was what he called the ‘semantic web.’ Instead of rooting around a shaky
                    network of hyperlinks to find what they were looking for, users would be able to rely on a system
                    that could find the relevant information intuitively. Within a year, a new term was coined: Web 3.0,
                    marking the web’s evolution beyond the 1.0 era of HTML web pages and early e-commerce into the
                    gaudier 2.0 period, which saw the birth of social media and ‘user-generated content’.
                </p>
                <h4>
                    Web 2.0 vs Web 3.0
                </h4>
                <p>
                    Nowadays, people rarely talk about the semantic web, perhaps because its ambitions have largely been
                    realised. This is thanks in large part to the ability of search engines to tag and file millions of
                    websites using dedicated crawlers. “Search works much better because Google has all that
                    information,” explains Jim Hendler, a professor at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and an early
                    collaborator with Berners-Lee. “It’s able to index it and do all the magic they can do to keep it
                    working. But at the same time, that means if you want to look for something, you have to go to a
                    search engine that’s done that collecting and trust it.”

                    But this isn’t exactly the web that its creator wants. In Berners-Lee’s opinion, much of the success
                    of the Google’s and Facebook’s of the internet rested on their amassing of the personal data of
                    billions of ordinary consumers, over which the latter possessed no meaningful say in how it was
                    used. And so, together with collaborators at the start-up Inrupt, the inventor of the web now
                    proposes to remake his creation with a new platform that allows users to take back control in the
                    future. Known as ‘Solid,’ it affords consumers the ability to secure all the information about
                    themselves online into ‘personal online data stores,’ or pods – and force websites and public
                    institutions to ask them for access.
                </p>
                <h4>What does Web 3.0 look like?</h4>
                <p>Berners-Lee is not alone in thinking that the future of the web lies in decentralisation. Neither is
                    his the only vision for how that would work. The term has also become a rallying cry for those
                    experimenting with ‘Web 3.0’ projects such as cryptocurrencies, DAOs and decentralised finance
                    (DeFi). They envisage the next iteration of the web as a more transparent, freedom-loving space
                    where an individual’s data and speech will be immune from tampering and indelible, underwritten by
                    thousands of Blockchain ledgers. Meanwhile, a third vision for Web 3.0 sees digital information
                    liberated from our smartphones and laptops and embedded into the environment around us. This
                    so-called ‘spatial web’ will see virtual and augmented reality integrate with our daily lives.

                    Although they encapsulate different values and objectives, these three visions may all come to pass,
                    overlapping and interacting. Because, however, the use of information on the internet evolves, the
                    notion of a singular web with finite boundaries is already dead.

                <label>Critics argue that the future of the web rests on moving away from its reliance on using personal
                    data to create efficient, personalised applications for consumers into something that protects user
                    privacy and security. (Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)</label>
                <h4>
                    Web 3.0: A decentralised web of personal data
                </h4>
                <p>The new Berners-Lee vision of Web 3.0 stems from concerns over personal data protection. It presumes
                    that users are disturbed by the accumulation of their data by Facebook, Google and Amazon and will
                    embrace a model that puts them in control. Solid is designed to do just that, giving all requests
                    for personal data from websites, companies or state institutions to an individual’s data vault, or
                    ‘Pod,’ for authentication.
                    Models like Solid, says Hendler, might help to create a whole new market for data brokerage. He
                    points to digital advertising, in which companies pay website operators to target ads to users based
                    on their online behaviour and other data. “Money is exchanged between them and I don’t get any of
                    it,” says Hendler. If personal data were under the control of the user, data brokers might pay them
                    fractional fees for access. Opportunities also lie in improving aspects of healthcare like dementia
                    treatment, with Solid’s architects arguing that pods could contain not only medical records, but
                    information on personal preferences and routines that help to keep patients grounded.
                </p>
                <p>Trials of Solid’s software on the NHS began late last year, with a similar pilot project underway at
                    NatWest and the regional government of Flanders. Not that the enterprise has been immune from
                    criticism. While Solid is intended to eventually act as its own development platform for whole new
                    applications, some have questioned whether the model would actually live up to its promise of
                    economic advantage for consumers. ‘The fundamental flaw of such a system is that data is of little
                    value when it is bought and sold on its own,’ recently argued media expert Dr Pieter Verdegem. “The
                    value of data only emerges from its aggregation and analysis, accrued via network effects.”</p>
                <p>Solid also bears an eerie resemblance to another technology that makes similar promises about
                    privacy, security and a decentralised future for the web. “Blockchain and Solid are different,” said
                    Berners-Lee at last year’s Web Summit: while advocates envision multiple, indelible ledgers
                    recording all kinds of data across the internet for the world to see, the latter concentrates on
                    securing personal or institutional data inside individual private vaults.</p>
                <p>In that sense, the Berners-Lee vision for Web 3.0 isn’t all that different from Web 1.0: a place
                    where users can reap the benefits of the free and instantaneous exchange of information, without the
                    need to reveal too much of their private data – albeit now with the software to enforce that rule.
                </p>
                <h4>Is Web 3.0 good for free speech?</h4>
                <p>Devotees of blockchain, meanwhile, imagine a much more disrupted web in the future, with the
                    technology affording economic transformation in cryptocurrencies and NFTs, and the basic
                    organisation of society in the flowering of distributed autonomous organisations (DAOs.) What’s
                    more, supporters argue that its popularisation will restore free speech on the internet to its
                    original, uncensored form – with the added failsafe that, on a blockchain network, it is
                    (theoretically) impossible to delete information undetected.</p>
                <p>Some of the impetus for this vision of a decentralised web is socio-political. “What I think is
                    pushing this generation of the decentralised web forwards is, probably, the re-emergence of more
                    libertarian views that were quite popular in the 90s” in the tech community, explains Dr Edina
                    Harbinja of Aston University.</p>

                <h4>Is Web 3.0 already here?</h4>
                <p>Some facets of the decentralised web are beginning to be adopted by the mainstream, most notably in
                    the form of NFTs. However, that doesn’t apply to key aspects of this ‘Web 3.0’ vision – most notably
                    in the issue of free speech on the internet. After all, things have changed since the early days of
                    the web. Society has become less idealistic about uncensored publication and more familiar with the
                    challenges social networks face in moderating hate speech, misinformation and illegal content. So
                    far, decentralisation has only seemed to revive these problems: decentralised social media platform
                    Mastodon decried the migration of far-right Gab users to its servers but was unable to stop them.
                </p>
                <p>Meanwhile governments, many of whom are seeking to increase regulation of the digital sphere, are
                    unlikely to tolerate a truly decentralised web. “Wearing rose-tinted glasses, I could see [it]
                    protecting diversity of thoughts and opinions and reduc[ing] the risk of monitoring, tracking and
                    targeting of at-risk or marginalised individuals or groups,” says Australia’s eSafety Commissioner
                    Julie Inman-Grant, a responsibility that she acknowledges search and social media giants have failed
                    to live up to. Nevertheless, the lack of in-built mechanisms for centralised authority in
                    decentralised apps means that moderating illegal and harmful content is extremely difficult. “If no
                    one is responsible or accountable, how does one remediate potential harm?”</p>
                <p>As such, both Inman-Grant and Harbinja find it difficult to imagine a purely decentralised web that
                    national authorities can readily accept, at least without stronger in-built protections that prevent
                    the spread of criminal and extremist content. That might be different in emerging markets, however,
                    where state authority is weaker and where support for decentralised innovations such as blockchain
                    and cryptocurrencies is much stronger. “We’ve seen that with Web 2.0, in the Arab Spring and the use
                    of social media,” says Harbinja. Even so, this effect alone is unlikely to lead to a global embrace
                    of such technologies, she believes.
                </p>
                <p>State resistance isn’t the only obstacle to the decentralised web. It is hard to see how the likes of
                    Facebook or Google would willingly bend to such a model, at least not without significant market
                    pressure. There are decentralised versions of their popular offerings, including video sharing sites
                    and online word processors, but their performance is often found to be lacking.

                    and projected forms. (Photo by STR/AFP via Getty Images)</label>
                <h4>The spatial web</h4>
                <p>There is another vision for the future of the web – one that’s concerned less with philosophical
                    principles in how we use the web than the evolution of the practicalities of access. In the
                    so-called ‘Spatial Web,’ our interactions with the internet will be defined by how we interact with
                    it through physical surfaces and filters – essentially, the apotheosis of the ‘internet of things’
                    of connected devices embedded in our homes, cars, offices and cities.
                    <br>
                    “You’d wake up in the morning, and you could [look out] your window, and it will automatically be
                    telling you about the weather,” explains Dr Allan V Cook, managing director and Digital Reality
                    Business leader at Deloitte Digital – the kind of world where news headlines pop up on bathroom
                    mirrors and meetings are conducted in virtual reality.
                    <br>
                    Indeed, workable versions of this technology are already with us, albeit expensive products usually
                    found in corporate design workshops. Even so, says Cook, prices are coming down, with VR and AR
                    devices becoming readily affordable for the ordinary consumer. The tipping point for more widespread
                    adoption, he says, is the creation of useful content for these platforms. But there are signs that
                    the market is receptive – one being the popularity of video filters.
                    <br>
                    “Snap filters, where I can put a unicorn horn on my forehead, or I can change my hair green, [is]
                    fun,” says Cook. “But then it becomes a tool where you start to say, ‘Hey, there’s actually utility
                    behind this’,” a way to trial a new shade of lipstick or hair dye, or how a piece of furniture might
                    look in a living room.
                    <br>
                    This vision for Web 3.0 is not entirely incompatible with parallel ambitions for a decentralised
                    internet. Blockchain, for example, can play a useful (if not all-encompassing) role in ledgering and
                    automating contractual agreements, while edge computing will be necessary in handling the huge AR
                    and VR files. Crucially, though, this vision doesn’t really break the model of companies controlling
                    personal data, and governments regulating its uses. Indeed, in some ways, it pushes it even further.
                    Not only will the Spatial Web hunger for more data on users' locations and online interactions, but
                    in some cases monitor sweat responses, eye movements, even facial expressions. “These technologies
                    will know us better than we know ourselves,” says Cook.
                    <br>
                    He acknowledges this will bring its own problems. A world where brand interaction moves off screens
                    and into smart glasses is bound to result in abuses: hackers daubing e-graffiti over landmarks
                    perhaps, or sinister, deepfake-based X-Ray spec applications. Depressingly, all this is to be
                    expected – but is Web 3.0 the best way to describe it?
                    <br>
                    Probably not, says Cook. The same goes for any vision of a decentralised internet, argues Hendler
                    and Harbinja. When the term ‘Web 3.0’ was tentatively coined in 2006, there was a clear line between
                    the web of hypertext pages encountered on computer screens and the infrastructure of the internet
                    that made it all possible. That now seems almost impossible given how much of humanity now lives
                    their lives online, through a plethora of devices. Indeed, the web, for all intents and purposes,
                    may be dead. Whatever comes next will need a new name.
